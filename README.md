All steps are labeled in the html file itself.

Step 1: Create an HTML document and reference Moment.js and Lodash.

Step 2: Create a date variable and use at least two different Moment.js functionality from what
you see in the class example to manipulate the date you created earlier.

For this I used the 'startOf()' and 'subtract()' functions to manipulate the date.


Step 3: Create an array in JavaScript. Now use Lodash functionality to retrieve information
about the array and manipulate the array with one different function from what you learn in class
example.

For this, I used the 'pull' array to remove members of the array.
